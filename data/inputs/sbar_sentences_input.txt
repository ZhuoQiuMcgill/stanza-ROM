The boy who sings is my friend.
The artist who painted this is famous.
The girl whom I met is nice.
The movie that we watched was amazing.
The man whose car broke down.
The boy whose father is a doctor is my classmate.
2018 was the year when I moved to Canada.
I remember the day when we met.
This is the place where we stayed.
I don’t know the reason why he left.
I stayed home because it was raining.
Although she was tired, she finished the report.
Inspired by those cherished memories, Sarah decided to start a journal to preserve them.
She described not only the stories her grandmother shared, but also the emotions they stirred.
The emotions of nostalgia, comfort, and love gave her writing a heartfelt tone that surprised her.
Her friends who read the journal found themselves moved by its sincerity and vivid details.
She smiled as she read about the time they built a treehouse together.
It is a lie that you love her.
She waited by the window, hoping you would return.
Design a vacation house that can fly easily from one location to another.
Design a web system to manage the editorial workflow of the JIDPS journal.
I don't know whether he’ll call or text.
She’s unsure whether to accept the job or continue studying.
This task is not as easy as it looks.
She enjoys painting as much as she enjoys dancing.
Just as the moon affects the tides, so does the sun influence them.
Just as honesty builds trust, so does kindness.
Just as we need water to survive, so do plants need sunlight.
No sooner had she sat down than the phone rang.
I’d rather read a book than watch TV.
What she said surprised everyone.
That he lied was obvious.
Whether we will win depends on our effort.
How she managed to escape is still a mystery.
When the meeting starts is still unknown.
I know that she is right.
She didn’t tell me what had happened.
We’re thinking about how we can solve the problem.
He’s not sure if he locked the door.
I don’t know when the package will arrive.
The truth is that she never left.
My suggestion is that we take a break.
The problem is how we can get there.
The question is whether he will accept the offer.
I heard the news that she got married.
The idea that hard work brings success is widely accepted.
She rejected the suggestion that we cancel the meeting.
We faced the fact that we were out of time.
