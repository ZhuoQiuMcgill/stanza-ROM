The boy who sings is my friend.
The artist who painted this is famous.
The girl whom I met is nice.
The movie that we watched was amazing.
The man whose car broke down.
The boy whose father is a doctor is my classmate.
2018 was the year when I moved to Canada.
I remember the day when we met.
This is the place where we stayed.
I donâ€™t know the reason why he left.
