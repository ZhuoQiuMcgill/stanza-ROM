What she said surprised everyone.
That he lied was obvious.
Whether we will win depends on our effort.
How she managed to escape is still a mystery.
When the meeting starts is still unknown.
I know that she is right.
She didn’t tell me what had happened.
We’re thinking about how we can solve the problem.
He’s not sure if he locked the door.
I don’t know when the package will arrive.
The truth is that she never left.
My suggestion is that we take a break.
The problem is how we can get there.
The question is whether he will accept the offer.
I heard the news that she got married.
The idea that hard work brings success is widely accepted.
She rejected the suggestion that we cancel the meeting.
We faced the fact that we were out of time.
