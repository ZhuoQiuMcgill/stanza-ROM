## Individual Sentence Results

### Sentence 1
**Input:** I stayed home because it was raining.

| Metric | Count | Rate |
|--------|-------|------|

**❌ Missing Relations:**
- because → was: predicate (verb/proposition - object)
- it → was: predicate (subject - verb)
- stayed → home: predicate (verb/proposition - object)
- was → raining: predicate (verb/proposition - object)

**➕ Over-specified Relations:**
- because → raining: predicate (conjunction - clause_verb)
- home → stayed: constraint
- it → raining: predicate (subject - verb)
- raining → stayed: constraint
- was → raining: constraint
