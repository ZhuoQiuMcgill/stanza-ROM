# ROM Relation Analysis Report: Gemini 2.5 Pro vs. Basic Sentences Benchmark

## Executive Summary

This report presents a detailed analysis comparing Gemini 2.5 Pro's ROM relation generation against the basic sentences
benchmark standard. The analysis covers 21 sentences across different complexity levels, evaluating 3 key metrics:

| Metric                      | Rate      | Description                                                        |
|-----------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Missing Relation Rate**   | **32.4%** | Relations present in benchmark but absent in Gemini's output       |
| **Over-specification Rate** | **33.3%** | Relations generated by Gemini that don't exist in the benchmark    |
| **Correct Relation Rate**   | **60.3%** | Relations from the benchmark correctly captured in Gemini's output |

## Detailed Analysis by Sentence

### 1. "Inspired by those cherished memories, Sarah decided to start a journal to preserve them."

**Missing Relations (5):**

- `memories → inspired: Predicate`
- `Sarah → cherished: Predicate`
- `to → decided: Constraint`
- `journal → preserve: Predicate`
- `them → memories: Connection`

**Over-specifications (4):**

- `by → Inspired: Constraint`
- `by → memories: Predicate`
- `decided → start: Predicate`
- `preserve → them: Predicate`

**Correct Relations (6):**

- `Inspired → Sarah: Constraint`
- `those → memories: Constraint`
- `Sarah → decided: Predicate`
- `a → journal: Constraint`
- `to → start: Constraint`
- `to → preserve: Predicate`

### 2. "She described not only the stories her grandmother shared, but also the emotions they stirred."

**Missing Relations (6):**

- `shared → stories: Predicate`
- `not only → described: Constraint`
- `not only → stories: Predicate`
- `but also → described: Constraint`
- `but also → emotions: Predicate`
- `stirred → emotions: Predicate`

**Over-specifications (5):**

- `not → only: Constraint`
- `only → stories: Constraint`
- `shared → stories: Constraint`
- `but → emotions: Constraint`
- `also → emotions: Constraint`

**Correct Relations (8):**

- `she → described: Predicate`
- `described → stories: Predicate`
- `the → stories: Constraint`
- `her → grandmother: Constraint`
- `grandmother → shared: Predicate`
- `described → emotions: Predicate`
- `the → emotions: Constraint`
- `they → stirred: Predicate`

### 3. "The emotions of nostalgia, comfort, and love gave her writing a heartfelt tone that surprised her."

**Missing Relations (9):**

- `writing → tone: Constraint`
- `tone → that: Connection`
- `tone → surprised: Predicate`
- `of → emotion: Constraint`
- `of → comfort: Predicate`
- `of → love: Predicate`
- `nostalgia → and: Connection`
- `comfort → and: Connection`
- `love → and: Connection`

**Over-specifications (6):**

- `The → emotions: Constraint`
- `of → emotions: Predicate`
- `comfort → nostalgia: Constraint`
- `and → comfort: Constraint`
- `love → nostalgia: Constraint`
- `surprised → tone: Constraint`

**Correct Relations (9):**

- `emotions → gave: Predicate`
- `gave → writing: Predicate`
- `her → writing: Constraint`
- `gave → tone: Predicate`
- `a → tone: Constraint`
- `heartfelt → tone: Constraint`
- `that → surprised: Predicate`
- `surprised → her: Predicate`
- `of → nostalgia: Predicate`

## Key Observations

1. **Directional Errors**: Gemini often reversed the direction of relationships compared to the benchmark, especially
   with prepositional phrases (e.g., "with → stayed" vs. "stayed → with").

2. **Connection Relations**: Gemini struggled significantly with identifying "Connection" relation types, frequently
   missing them or categorizing them differently.

3. **Complex Sentences**: Performance degraded in more complex sentences with multiple clauses, especially those with
   coordinating conjunctions and nested relationships.

4. **Strong Basic Relations**: Gemini performed well on basic subject-verb-object relations, demonstrating good
   understanding of core sentence structure.

5. **Adverbial and Prepositional Relations**: Gemini often had difficulty correctly analyzing the relationship between
   adverbs/prepositions and their head words.

## Conclusion

Gemini 2.5 Pro shows moderate performance in ROM relation extraction with a correct relation rate of 60.3%. It maintains
good coverage of core syntactic relationships but struggles with more nuanced connections and hierarchical
relationships. The high over-specification rate (33.3%) suggests Gemini tends to create more granular or different
relation structures than the benchmark standard.

Improvement opportunities exist in relation direction handling, consistent relation type assignment, and capturing
implicit/connection relationships between entities.
